## 📦 Crowdfunding Smart Contract (Aptos Blockchain)

### 📝 1. **Title of the Project**

**Crowdfunding DApp Smart Contract using Move on Aptos**

---

### 📖 2. **Description of the Project**

This project is a simple smart contract built using the **Move language** for the **Aptos blockchain** that enables users to:

* **Create crowdfunding campaigns** with a specified funding goal.
* **Contribute Aptos tokens (APT)** to support other users' projects.

It consists of two core functions:

* `create_project`: Initializes a project with a funding goal.
* `contribute`: Allows other users to send funds and support the project.

---

### 🌟 3. **Vision**

To **empower developers, creators, and social entrepreneurs** to raise funds in a decentralized and transparent way using blockchain technology.
We aim to reduce reliance on centralized crowdfunding platforms and give full control to the project owners and supporters.

---

### 🚀 4. **Future Scope**

In future versions, this smart contract can be extended to include:

* **Refund logic** if the funding goal is not met.
* **Deadline/expiry** for each campaign.
* **Multiple campaigns per user**.
* **Reward system** for contributors.
* **Progress tracking** and public visibility of campaign status.
* **NFT rewards** for top supporters.
